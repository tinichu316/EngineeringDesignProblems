# Introduction

These are a series of coding challenges given in an introductory Python programming course.

#### Challenge 1:
Design a function that calculates two-stage forward kinematics. The function takes four inputs, the length of the two arms, and the angle from one arm to the line of action of the other arm (or the ground).

#### Challenge 2:
Design a MadLibs game that prompts the user for various verbs, nouns, and adjectives.
The story is hard coded and does not vary on the amount of information placed in (although it is based on 3 of each verb, noun, and adjective).

As a bonus, each user defined word is randomly selected from the total number that they made (so technically they can enter as many words as they want).

Further, one of the nouns is repeated in an attempt to make the story seem more cohesive.
